# odin-recipes
This is a repository where I keep my project "Recipes" which I have done while doing The Odin Project. This project is to test my skills which I have got through doing the foundation html part of The Oin Project. By this project I will be showcasing my basic HTML skills like using different elements and attributes to create a static website. It will have links, images and more different elements.
